## Description
For our HARP 151 Final Project at Binghamton University, we decided to make a program that compiles movie reviews from 4 separate platforms: Youtube, Rotten Tomatoes, TMDB, and Google Reviews. These reviews were sorted by Vader Sentiment Analysis, a third party Python library. These were all compiled into a GUI made from Tkinter.

## Dependencies
- vaderSentiment (https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)
- Selenium
- Youtube API
- TMDB API
- Tkinter
